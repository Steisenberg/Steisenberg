Hello, I'm the long lost son of heisenberg. My journey consists of RickRolling boomers computers, hacking the blockchain, tax evasion, igniting explosives in the desert, and installing boot sector malware that consists of, "Don't tread on me" anime memes on the Glowies devices. I'm usually hotter than a hoochies coochie, but we all have those days of getting dried up. I was born a son of a lawless man, so I'm kinda roudy, which is why I transverse the desert constantly looking for a soul to steal. I'm a freedom fighter that weilds open source tools that is custom patched for my conquest for life, libery, and the pursuit of happiness. I don't conversate with commies, whoops i'm sorry, i meant windows/mac users. Have a nice day :)
